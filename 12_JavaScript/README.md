# Project 12 | JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

For this assignment, we will create web pages to easily search through the UFO Sightings data collection.  we will write a code that will create a table dynamically based upon a provided dataset, and allow our users to search through the table for specific pieces of information.  We will only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for our web pages.
