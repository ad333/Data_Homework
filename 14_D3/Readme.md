# Project 14 | Data Journalism and D3

    Using the data from the United States Census Bureau and CDC, I looked for the correlation between percentage of people living under poverty and percentage of people with no healthcare coverage for each US states.  Then I visualized the correlation with a scatter plot and embeded the graphic into an .html file.  Finally I also used the d3 tooltip options to make the chart more interactive.
