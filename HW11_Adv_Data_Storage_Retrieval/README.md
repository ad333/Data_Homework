In this project called 'Surfs Up', I decided to do some climate analysis to help me with my vacation trip to Honolulu, Hawaii.  This project involves 4 different parts which are explained below:

Step 1 - Data Engineering
    The climate data for Hawaii is provided through two CSV files. I used Python and Pandas to inspect the content of these CSV files and cleaned the data.

Step 2 - Database Engineering
    For this step, I used SQLAlchemy to model my table schemas and create a sqlite database for my tables. I used one table for measurements and one for stations.    

Step 3 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
    For this step, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration on my new weather station tables. All of the following analysis were completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  I did the Precipitation analysis, Stations analysis and Temperature analysis.

Step 4 - Climate App
    For this step, I designed a Flask api based on the queries that I had just developed earlier.  I used FLASK to create my routes.
