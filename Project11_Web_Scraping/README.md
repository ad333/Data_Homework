For this assignment, we will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.  

1) In the first step, we will complete the initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

2) In the second step, we will use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.
